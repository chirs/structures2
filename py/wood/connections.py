## connections

wood is usually fastened using steel - nails, screws, bolts, and specially formed steel fasteners

### bolted joints

principle concerns for steel bolts in wood
1. net cross section in member - holes reduce wood member cross section. bolt holes are 1/16" wider than bolt.
2. bearing of the bolt on the wood - stress varies wood grain angle.
3. bending of the bolt - long thin bolts in thick wood members will bend considerably.
4. number of members bolted at a single joint - ?
5. ripping out of bolt when too close to edge

### nailed joints

common wire nail most common.

critical concerns:
1. nail size - diameter and length; 
2. load direction - pullout loading (withdrawal), lateral load
3. penetration
4. species and grade of wood



### plywood gussets
