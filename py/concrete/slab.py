# Different systems to achieve flat spans
# 1. One-way solid slab and beam
# 2. Two-way solid slab and beam
# 3. One-way joist
# 4. Two-way flat slab or flat plate without beams
# 5. Two-way joist (waffle construction)



# Given loads and spans, determine a slab thickness.


# To find a slab thickness, consider three factors
# 1. minimum thickness for deflection
# 2. minimum effective depth for maximum moment
# 3. minimum effective depth for maximum shear
