resistance factor
nominal resistance of the member
load factor
different loading effects

stress-strain response


top chord, bottom chord, weld, wide flange section, cut

connection methods:
rivets
high-strength bolts



elastic theory:

maximum_moment = elastic_yield_value * cross_section

plastic_moment = elastic_yield_value * plastic_section_modulus
