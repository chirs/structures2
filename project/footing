cost effective -> reduce steel reinforcement to a minimum.

keep footing <= 5x wall thickness.

bending of footer, shear of footer.

maximum bar spacing: 18in
minimum bar spacing: 6in.
smaller bars are preferable.



common footings:
* wall footing
* column footing

* foundation walls
* pedestals  



At sufficient wall foundation width, minimum thickness is determined also.
Otherwise, minimum thickness is 8in non-reinforced, 10in reinforced.


1. assume footing thickness.
2. design for total load.
3. verify structural adequacy.
4. modify final width.



Transverse reinforcement - probably don't need it.


longitudinal reinforcement = .0015x (.15%) gross concrete area. (footing cross-section area)    


assuming an under-reinforced section (a/d <= .2)





DETERMINING COLUMN FOOTINGS:

* quick footing size estimate -> load / max soil pressure
  (does not include footing weight, so is an underestimate.)

* for a footing of significant size (eg 125ft^2) -> thickness is just a guess. Aim for something reasonable (30in?)
 - footing weight = inches thick * (150/12)

* Now adjust soil pressure for footing weight and recompute load / adj. soil pressure; use that number to get footing dimensions.
* Now, re-do footing dimensions using round numbers. Recalculate design soil pressure again.


Pu = factored soil pressure = 1.2* DL + 1.6 * LL (in kips)
pd = design soil pressure = Pu / footing area (in psf)

balanced moment capacity = Rbd^2 -> bending stress should not be critical.


shear will be critical, either beam-type or punching.

Designers prefer to use largest bar possible in fewest number (simplify bar laying.)

Consider using thicker footing with less steel.

Minimum amount of steel: .0015Ag


Pedestals: 

pedestal is a compression member where height <= 3*width
