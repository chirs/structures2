cost effective -> reduce steel reinforcement to a minimum.

keep footing <= 5x wall thickness.

bending of footer, shear of footer.

maximum bar spacing: 18in
minimum bar spacing: 6in.
smaller bars are preferable.



common footings:
* wall footing
* column footing

* foundation walls
* pedestals  



At sufficient wall foundation width, minimum thickness is determined also.
Otherwise, minimum thickness is 8in non-reinforced, 10in reinforced.


1. assume footing thickness.
2. design for total load.
3. verify structural adequacy.
4. modify final width.



Transverse reinforcement - probably don't need it.


longitudinal reinforcement = .0015x (.15%) gross concrete area. (footing cross-section area)    


assuming an under-reinforced section (a/d <= .2)
